Summary
=======

In this project I create a console that provides video game analysis consisting of, but not limited to, video 
game popularity, ratings, rankings, and general details (i.e. genre, developers, release year, etc.). Datasets 
used in this project are publicly available at <https://rawg.io/> and <statista.com>. Queries and functionalities 
include:

-User search for a specific game or genre
-Video game cost of production vs game profits
-What are the most popular games for each specified console (i.e. XBOX, PS4/5, Nintendo)
-What are the highest rated games of the past decade
-What games/genre's were most popular pre-pandemic vs post-pandemic
-Most anticipated games of the year (starting 2015)
-More as needed..
